#  Daily Dose of Sunshine

Gymnopédie No.1 captures the anxiety, sorrow, and hope within the ward through its simple melody and slow tempo. Instead of depicting mental illness solely as suffering, the piece gently reflects the quiet flow of time and inner lives of the patients. It helps the drama present illness not as a tragedy or something to overcome, but as a natural part of daily life. The music often plays when the main character, Daeun—a nurse and also a patient—appears. By doing so, it softens the boundary between “normal” and “abnormal,” reinforcing the drama’s core message: a warm, equal view of all human beings.
