# A Beautiful Mind

This music is used in a scene expressing the genius and inner world of the protagonist, John Nash. Composed in a theme-and-variations form, the piece creates a calm yet graceful atmosphere, harmonizing perfectly with Nash's emotions as he discovers and immerses himself in mathematical patterns.By using the less commonly known first movement instead of the famous third movement, the film captures an elegant feeling, effectively reflecting the complicated situations Nash is experiencing.
This scene simultaneously portrays Nash's brilliant mind and his lonely inner world resulting from his mental illness. Mozart's music deeply enhances the portrayal of these complex emotions.
