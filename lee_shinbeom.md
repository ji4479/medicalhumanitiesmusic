# Amadeus

<<Requiem in D minor, K. 626, Lacrimosa>> symbolically depicts Mozart's weakened south and spirit. In the film, the piece is used in the incident where Mozart speaks his last words on his sickbed, and the atmosphere of his dislike for music stimulates his sense of collapse and death. The trembling of the instruments expresses his anxious psychological state, and the sorrowful strings of the chorus express the pain of his treatment. From a physics and engineering perspective, the pitch and dynamics of the piece produce the effect of converting human physiological and psychological states into sound wave compression and combination, expanding the phenomenal resonance.
