# Wonder

The song 'Heroes' contains the following lyrics: 'Though nothing will drive them away / We can beat them, just for one day / We can be heroes, just for one day'. Because the main character August has facial deformity, he has to fight through all the bias and the prejudice the world burdens him. The lyrics send a message that no matter what, the world will throw problems at him, and we can't do much to drive all the prejudice the world throws at him away. However, although life is hard and things are tough, the song implies that he can beat all that burden, and that he can still be hero in his own perspective and life, regardless of how others see him.
