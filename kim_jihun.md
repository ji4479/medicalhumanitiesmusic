# Everybody Hurts

R.E.M.â€™s "Everybody Hurts" (1992) portrays the emotions of depression and despair not as signs of personal weakness, but as universal aspects of the human experience. The song reveals the pain of isolated individuals while reminding listeners that everyone hurts sometimes, thus seeking to pull those facing suicidal thoughts out of their isolation. Rather than dramatizing or pathologizing suffering, it approaches emotional distress with a quiet, communal language of consolation, which gives the song its profound power.
