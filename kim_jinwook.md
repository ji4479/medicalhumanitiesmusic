# Keys to the Heart

The main character, Jintae, who has level 2 autism, is a genius with an extraordinary talent for playing the piano. He lives in poverty with his older brother and mother,
and although he delivers flyers with his brother to earn daily wages, he sneaks away to play the piano, driven by his deep passion for music.
Recognizing Jintae’s remarkable gift and dedication, his brother Joha enters him in a piano competition, where Jintae wins a prize. 
Through his performance, Jintae transcends his disability and channels it into a passionate expression of music.
The film warmly portrays how others view Jintae’s playing—with kindness and admiration—and shows how his music brings harmony and warmth to a family with a disabled member.
