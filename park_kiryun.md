# Bohemian Rhapsody

"The Show Must Go On" was completed by Freddie Mercury during a time when he was suffering from the physical pain and weakness caused by AIDS, capturing his determination to stay on stage until the very end. The lyric, "Inside my heart is breaking, my makeup may be flaking, but my smile still stays on," shows how, even as his body deteriorated, he fiercely preserved his dignity as an artist. This song powerfully portrays the struggle to transform the despair brought by illness into art while hiding the pain. Through this song, Freddie left behind a testament to his unwavering commitment to music and life even in the face of death.
