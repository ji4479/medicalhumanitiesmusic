# 말아톤(film maraton)

In the film Marathon, the use of "Ave Maria" beautifully expresses the pure and delicate inner world of the protagonist, Cho-won. The soft and clear melody of the piece harmonizes with Cho-won's transparent view of the world, allowing the audience to understand autism not as a deficiency but as a unique way of being. The sacred atmosphere of "Ave Maria" highlights the nobility of Cho-won's life and emphasizes his purity in the face of social prejudice. Through this, viewers are encouraged to see disability not merely as a limitation, but as a profound form of human existence. The music silently conveys Cho-won's emotions and naturally fosters a warm and respectful perspective on disability.
