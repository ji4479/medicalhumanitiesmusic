# A Silent Voice

In animation, voice serves as a crucial medium for revealing the inner states of characters, while music complements this by articulating illness and disability in a tangible manner. Musical elements such as unstable rhythms, fractured harmonies, and broken melodic lines convey psychological anxiety, physical limitations, and disruptions in communication on a sensory level. Layered over these musical textures, the voice—through its tremors and distortions—intensifies the portrayal of pain and isolation. Thus, music and voice together transform the depiction of illness and disability from mere narrative devices into vivid auditory experiences, enhancing the audience’s sensory understanding.
