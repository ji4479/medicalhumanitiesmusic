# Knockin' on Heaven's Door

The original song was featured in the 1973 film Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, directed by Sam Peckinpah. In Knockin' on Heaven's Door, after being diagnosed with a terminal illness, two protagonists go through various events together. Eventually, they decide to fulfill one last wish—to see the ocean—and set off on a road trip. While enjoying vodka and cigars, they finally arrive at the long-awaited beach. The two silently gaze out at the sea. Suddenly, the protagonist’s friend suffers a seizure and passes away. The protagonist stares blankly at his friend, then quietly lets him go. The final scene shows the protagonist sitting by the ocean, waiting for his own approaching death, creating a lingering emotional impact. In film, a cover version by the German rock band Selig was used, with greater emphasis on the band's instrumentation and performed in a lower key compared to the original. The first verse is sung solely by the vocalist, and from the second verse onward, a chorus joins in, similar to the original version. The refrain and instrumental sections are repeated, extending the overall length of the song and enhancing the lingering emotion of the ending.
