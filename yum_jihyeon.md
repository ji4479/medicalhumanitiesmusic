# Love in the Big City

"The Love Law of a Big City" is a drama that explores the complexities of love, identity, and illness within a modern urban setting. In the story, the protagonist, Go-Young, is diagnosed with HIV. Due to the emotional difficulty associated with directly acknowledging the illness, he refers to it as "Kylie," named after the pop star Kylie Minogue. This approach reflects his effort to normalize the condition within his life, demonstrating a mindset focused on integration rather than avoidance. Symbolically, by choosing Kylie—a figure celebrated in the LGBTQ+ community as an icon of hope and resilience—Go-Young frames his diagnosis not solely as a source of suffering, but as something that can coexist with strength and renewal.
