"Ordinary Kid" highlights the movie's core message, 'The Ordinary Kid,' and musically expresses Ohgi's inner world and emotions. It is used as the background for Ohgi's birth and surgical scenes. Fast-changing chords and repetitive melodies symbolically represent Ohgi's inner conflict and growth process.
