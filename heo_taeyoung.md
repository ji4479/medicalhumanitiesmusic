# Untouchable

Ludovico Einaudi's Fly delicately depicts the fragility of human existence and the strength that overcomes it through repetitive patterns and gradual ascents without directly explaining illness or disability. The simple and gentle piano melody that begins gently approaches as if to carefully embrace life again, and the gradually increasing rhythm carefully builds up the will to overcome physical limitations. This song appears in the movie Untouchable when Driss drives a car through the city with Philippe in a wheelchair. The camera focuses on the two people in the fast-moving car, and the light yet delicate rhythm of Fly fills the background, momentarily forgetting about their disability and enjoying freedom, further highlighting the laughter and sense of being alive. Therefore, this music does not express sadness or sympathy, but quietly but powerfully shows the light flight of the human spirit that overcomes disability and runs through life.
