# To Kill a Mockingbird

Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s main theme is composed of a simple and pure melody, symbolizing the innocence and helplessness of marginalized individuals, particularly Tom Robinson, who bears a physical disability. The music gently and poignantly embraces his innocence, quietly highlighting the vulnerability of characters placed before the heavy obstacle of societal prejudice.
