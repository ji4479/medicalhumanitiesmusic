# We Need to Talk About Kevin

In We Need to Talk About Kevin, the use of Buddy Holly’s "Everyday" serves as a chilling counterpoint to Kevin’s underlying antisocial and psychopathic traits. The song’s light, cheerful melody starkly contrasts with the emotional void and calculated malice that define Kevin’s character. By inserting such an innocent and upbeat track against the backdrop of a collapsing family and Kevin’s escalating violence, the film highlights the deceptive normalcy that often masks profound psychological dysfunction. "Everyday" transforms from a simple pop tune into a symbol of dissonance, emphasizing how Kevin’s disorder festers beneath the surface of ordinary life, unseen until it irreversibly fractures his world.
