# The Greatest Showman

"This Is Me" is a song used in the movie The Greatest Showman during a scene where characters with disabilities affirm and proudly express their existence. Sung by individuals who bear social stigmas due to their disabilities, the song serves as a message of liberation from social marginalization. The film effectively portrays the characters' journey of reclaiming their agency and confronting societal prejudices. Through the lyrics of the song, they reveal that they are no longer "freaks," but individuals who confidently stand on stage as human beings.
