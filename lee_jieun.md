# La Traviata

In particular, the music played at the moment of Violeta's death, the last scene, is very important. Act 3's aria "Addio del Passato" ("Barewell to the Past") expresses the scene of Violeta recognizing her imminent death and saying goodbye to loneliness in music.

In "La Traviata", music expresses the disease of tuberculosis in Violletta as a core of her emotions and humanity, rather than just a background setting. Especially in "Addio del Passato", it expresses the weakened body of Violletta and the fading flame of life through a soft and increasingly weak melody. The slow and thin melody implies inner peace as she prepares to leave the world, but at the same time dramatically highlights the transience of human existence and the despair caused by disease. Music goes beyond mere description and conveys to the audience the loneliness, regret, and obsession of love felt by Violeta.
